## Running the Backend

### Using IntelliJ IDEA

1. **Open the Project**:
   - Launch IntelliJ IDEA and open the project by selecting the `pom.xml` file located in the backend directory.

2. **Import Dependencies**:
   - IntelliJ will automatically import the Maven dependencies. If not, right-click on the `pom.xml` file and select `Maven` > `Reimport`.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Locate the main application class (usually annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`).
   - Right-click on the class and select `Run 'YourApplicationName'`.
   - The application will start, and you can view the console for any logs.

### Using Other IDEs

- For Eclipse or other IDEs, ensure that you have the necessary plugins for Maven and Spring Boot installed. Follow similar steps to import the project and run the application.

## Test and Coverage Reports

### Running Tests

- To run tests, execute the following command in the backend directory:
  ```bash
  ./mvnw test
  ```

### Generating Coverage Reports

- To generate coverage reports, you can use the following command:
  ```bash
  ./mvnw test jacoco:report
  ```
- The coverage reports will be generated in the `target/site/jacoco` directory. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the coverage details.

## Additional Knowledge

### Initializing a Spring Boot Project from start.spring.io

To create a new Spring Boot project from **start.spring.io**, follow these steps:

#### 1. **Open start.spring.io**
   - Navigate to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) in your web browser.
     <img width="1678" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53580132-d1fa-40b7-b193-16f7b9ad07fd" />


#### 2. **Project Configuration**
   - Choose the project type:
     - **Maven** (default) or **Gradle**.
   - Choose the language:
     - **Java** (default), **Kotlin**, or **Groovy**.
   - Set the **Spring Boot version** (use the latest stable release).

#### 3. **Add Project Metadata**
   - Fill in the following fields:
     - **Group**: This typically represents your organization's domain name in reverse (e.g., `com.example`).
     - **Artifact**: This is the name of your project (e.g., `shopping-panda`).
     - **Name**: The display name of your application (defaults to the artifact name).
     - **Description**: A brief description of the project (e.g., `A simple shopping management application`).
     - **Package Name**: Automatically generated based on the group and artifact (you can customize it if needed).

#### 4. **Dependencies**
   - Click on **Add Dependencies** and select the necessary dependencies for your project. For example:
     - **Spring Web**: For building REST APIs.
     - **Spring Data JPA**: For database interactions.
     - **MySQL Driver**: To connect to a MySQL database.
     - **Spring Boot DevTools**: For hot-reloading during development.
     - **Lombok**: To reduce boilerplate code.

#### 5. **Generate the Project**
   - Once you've configured the project, click the **Generate** button.
   - A `.zip` file containing the project will be downloaded.

#### 6. **Extract the Project**
   - Extract the downloaded `.zip` file to your desired location.

#### 7. **Open the Project in an IDE**
   - Open the extracted project folder in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).
   - If you are using IntelliJ IDEA:
     - Open the project by selecting the `pom.xml` file.
     - Ensure Maven dependencies are imported (IntelliJ usually does this automatically).

#### 8. **Run the Application**
   - Locate the main application class (annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`).
   - Run the class to start the application:
     - In IntelliJ IDEA: Right-click the file and select **Run 'YourApplicationName'**.
     - Alternatively, use the terminal:
       ```bash
       ./mvnw spring-boot:run
       ```

#### 9. **Verify the Application**
   - Once the application starts, verify it by accessing `http://localhost:8080` in your browser or testing an API endpoint using tools like Postman.
